# Example Docker Container for Python Projects

Welcome to Fred's Docker container setup guide for a standard Python project. This README will guide you through the process of setting up your Docker environment, starting the container, and managing releases efficiently.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get your Docker container up and running.

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

First, create a `.env` file from the provided template:

<code> cp env.template .env </code>

Once copied, open the `.env` file and modify the contents to suit your project's needs.

### Step 2: Launch Docker Container

To build or rebuild the Docker container with minimal hassle, use the `lazy_start.sh` script:

<code> bash lazy_start.sh  </code>

**NOTE**: If this is your first time running Docker commands, ensure that your user account is added to the Docker user group to avoid permission issues.

Alternatively, you can use standard Docker commands like:

<code> docker compose up </code>

### Step 3: Monitor Container Logs

To view the logs of your container, use the following command, replacing `<your_container_name>` and `<number_of_logs_display>` with appropriate values:

<code> docker logs <your_container_name> -n <number_of_logs_display> -f </code>

This will display a live feed of your container's logs.

## Releasing Your Project

When you're ready to release your Docker image, follow these steps.

### Step 1: Git Operations

Ensure all development code is merged onto the master branch, either in your local or remote repository.

### Step 2: Build Release

To build your release Docker images, execute:

<code> bash one_key_release.sh </code>

### Step 3: Verify Image List

Check that your Docker images are correctly built and listed:

<code> docker image ls </code>

This command will display all current Docker images, including your newly built ones.
